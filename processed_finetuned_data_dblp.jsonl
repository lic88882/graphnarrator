Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title combining(-0.02) artificial neural nets. abstract

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title(-0.05) relative role merging two- handed(-0.06)

The structure of the graph is as follows:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n  - Node-1.1\n  - Node-1.2\n  - Node-1.3\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n    - Node-2.5\n    - Node-2.6\n    - Node-2.7\n    - Node-2.8\n\n1. **Word-Level Evaluation:**\n\nThe ROOT node contains keywords such as \"interface,\" \"command,\" and \"selection,\" which are directly related to user interfaces. The presence of terms like \"pen-based,\" \"operation,\" and \"interaction techniques\" further emphasizes the focus on user interface design and functionality. The importance scores indicate that these keywords are central to the classification label \"User Interface.\"\n\n2. **Graph-Level Aggregation:**\n\n- **Node-1:** This node discusses human-computer interaction but is less relevant to user interfaces as it focuses more on replication studies rather than interface design.\n- **Node-1.1 to Node-1.3:** These nodes are also less relevant, as they do not directly address user interface concepts.\n- **Node-2:** This node is highly relevant, discussing \"pen-based user interfaces\" and \"interaction techniques,\" which are essential components of user interface design. The strong thematic connection between ROOT and Node-2 reinforces the classification.\n  - **Node-2.1 to Node-2.8:** These nodes further elaborate on various aspects of user interfaces, including visualization techniques, interaction methods, and user experiences, all of which support the classification.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of the ROOT node into the \"User Interface\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"interface,\" \"command,\" and \"selection\" indicates that the paper focuses on user interface design and functionality, particularly in the context of command selection techniques.\n  - Node-1: While this node discusses human-computer interaction, it is less directly related to user interfaces, as it focuses more on replication studies rather than interface design.\n  - Node-1.1 to Node-1.3: These nodes are also less relevant, as they do not directly address user interface concepts.\n  - Node-2: This node is highly relevant, discussing \"pen-based user interfaces\" and \"interaction techniques,\" which are essential components of user interface design. The strong thematic connection between the ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 to Node-2.8: These nodes further elaborate on various aspects of user interfaces, including visualization techniques, interaction methods, and user experiences, all of which support the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of the ROOT node into \"User Interface\" is well-supported by the presence of key terms related to user interfaces within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on user interface design and interaction techniques. The subsequent nodes provide additional context and detail, further reinforcing this classification.\n```"}]}

Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference.

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title(-0.03) bounded formula formulatype(-0.02) inline(-0.04)

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title teaching robots(-0.07) coordinate behaviours abstract

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title(-0.06) making good(-0.05) features(-0.00) track better

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title development(-0.01) biped(-0.01) walking(-0.04)

The additional context provided by the other nodes further reinforces this classification.\n```"}]}

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title(-0.00) scheme road(-0.03) extraction(-0.04) rural areas

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title(-0.09) new control(-0.06) mode(-0.00)

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title 3- model- based multiple- object video tracking(-0.01)

Nodes like Node-2.2 and Node-2.3 specifically address tracking multiple objects and handling occlusions, which are critical challenges in image processing.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of the ROOT node into the \"Image Processing\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords such as \"model,\" \"multiple,\" \"object,\" and \"video\" indicates that the paper focuses on methods for tracking objects in video sequences, which is a central task in image processing. The mention of \"semantic\" information further suggests an emphasis on analyzing visual data.\n\n- Node-1: This node discusses fuzzy technology in medicine, which is less directly related to image processing but touches on data analysis, a component of image processing.\n  - Node-1.1 to Node-1.8: These nodes primarily focus on various applications of fuzzy logic and adaptive systems in medical contexts. While they are not directly related to image processing, some nodes, like Node-1.6 and Node-1.8, mention monitoring and control systems, which can be linked to image processing in critical care environments.\n\n- Node-2: This node discusses \"real-time tracking\" and \"augmented reality,\" both of which are highly relevant to image processing. The emphasis on tracking objects in video sequences directly supports the classification.\n  - Node-2.1 to Node-2.7: These nodes further elaborate on tracking methods, 3D object tracking, and image-based localization, all of which are essential aspects of image processing. Nodes like Node-2.2 and Node-2.3 specifically address tracking multiple objects and handling occlusions, critical challenges in image processing.\n\nIn summary, the classification of the ROOT node into \"Image Processing\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key terms related to tracking and video analysis within the node itself and its direct connection to Node-2, which focuses on real-time tracking and object recognition. The subsequent nodes further reinforce this classification by discussing various tracking methods and applications in different contexts.\n```"}]}

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title(-0.07) physical(-0.03) layer(-0.03) security cognitive

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title optimization amplify- and- forward wireless(-0.03)

Label\nProbabilistic Methods\n\n### Reasoning\n\n0. Graph Structure Reconstruction:\n\nIn the provided verbalized graph, The ROOT node (first line) is the target for classification.\nSingle-digit indexed nodes are direct neighbors of ROOT.\nDouble-digit indexed nodes are:\n  - Two hops away from ROOT\n  - Direct children of their parent node\nMore digits indexed nodes follow the same principle as described above.\n\nThus, the graph structure of this verbalized graph is:\n\n- ROOT\n  - Node-1\n    - Node-1.1\n    - Node-1.2\n    - Node-1.3\n    - Node-1.4\n    - Node-1.5\n    - Node-1.6\n  - Node-2\n    - Node-2.1\n    - Node-2.2\n    - Node-2.3\n    - Node-2.4\n\n1. Word-Level Evaluation:\n\nDetect important terms for the classification label.\nQuantitatively, the importance (saliency) scores behind each word in the verbalized graph are calculated by a post-hoc XAI (explanable AI) algorithm.\nSemantically, keywords synonymous with or closely related to label, 'Probabilistic Methods' (such as 'probabilistic', 'probability', and 'inference'), are sementically influential in determining the classification because they directly indicate the node's relevance to the 'Probabilistic Methods' category.\n\n2. Graph-Level Aggregation:\n\nNode 1 does not contain as many directly relevant keywords. Yet, it still discusses POMDPs, which are probabilistic models, indicating that it contributes to the classification in a less significant way. \nDirect neighbors like Node 2, which contains the keyword 'probabilistic', have a substantial influence on ROOT node classification due to their close proximity to the ROOT node.\nIndirect neighbors, Nodes-2.1 to Node-2.4, connected through Node 2, contain keywords like 'probabilistic' and 'probability', which further reinforce the classification of ROOT. \nMeanwhile, the indirect neighbors connected through Node 1, Node-1.1 to Node-1.6, are less relevant because they do not include important keywords directly related to 'Probabilistic Methods'.\n\n### Free-Text Explanation\n```markdown\nThe classification of ROOT node into the \"Probabilistic Methods\" category can be explained as follows:\n\nROOT: The presence of keywords like \"probabilistic\" and \"inference\" within ROOT node suggests that the paper is focused on topics central to probabilistic methods, such as performing probabilistic inference and evaluating influence diagrams.\n  - Node-1: While Node 1 focuses on POMDPs, which are also probabilistic models, it is slightly less directly related to the probabilistic inference methods emphasized in ROOT node.\n    - Node-1.1 ~ Node-1.6: they are less relevant to probabilistic methods and thus contribute less to the classification.\n  - Node-2: This node discusses \"probabilistic inference\" and \"Bayesian networks,\" both of which are foundational to probabilistic methods. The strong thematic connection between ROOT node and Node 2 reinforces the classification.\n    - Node-2.1 ~ Node-2.4: they also discuss probabilistic topics, further supporting the classification.\n\nIn summary, the classification of ROOT node into \"Probabilistic Methods\" is well-supported by the strong presence of key probabilistic terms within the node itself and its direct connection to Node 2, which also focuses on probabilistic inference. Indirect neighbors through Node 2 further reinforce this classification.\n```\n\n## Task\n\n### Verbalized Graph\n<verbalized-graph>ROOT: title(-0.02) moviecut \u2014(-0.05) dynamic(-0.03) object
